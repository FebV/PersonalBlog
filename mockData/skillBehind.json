I will talk about every corners to explain the archtecture of the whole website.\n\n## frontend \nThe hotest frontend framework in current time is React.js of course, its one-way data binding and Component-based concept is very attractive. But the main reason for me to pick it is the ES6 grammar. Who can say no to the next(maybe the current) standard ? I also have learnt a little bit Angular 2, and have interests on it. But it's not as popular as I expect, maybe I can't find a set of components that I need. So I decide to choose React.js, the React Native is also attractive after I had spent a whole afternoon on it.",
